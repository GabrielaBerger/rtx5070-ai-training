# Repository Description for GitHub

## Short Description (for GitHub repo settings):
**Proprietary method for training AI models on RTX 5070 Ti GPUs - solving PyTorch sm_120 compatibility issues**

## Full Description:

### ðŸš€ RTX 5070 Ti AI Training Solution

This repository showcases the world's first successful AI model training on NVIDIA RTX 5070 Ti GPU architecture.

### What This Solves:
- PyTorch doesn't support RTX 5070 Ti's sm_120 compute capability
- Thousands of users get "no kernel image available" errors
- No existing solution until now

### My Achievement:
- âœ… Developed proprietary training method
- âœ… Successfully trained AI models on RTX 5070 Ti
- âœ… Achieved stable loss convergence
- âœ… 96GB RAM + 18-core optimization

### Commercial Offering:
